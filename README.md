Hello self!

You have made a decision to pursue an unknown world and leave your former career behind. You will look back at this message and will see how far you have come from knowing virtually nothing about web development to hopefully a decent developer : ) Remember why you are doing this and keep those goals in mind when times get tough. Goodbye corporate world!
